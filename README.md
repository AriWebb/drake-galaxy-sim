# Drake Equation Galaxy Simulation

An interactive 3D visualization of the Drake equation, simulating the potential for detectable civilizations in our galaxy and their expansion over time.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Galaxy**: Explore a realistic 3D model of a spiral galaxy with thousands of stars
- **Drake Equation Calculator**: Adjust parameters to estimate the number of detectable civilizations
- **Civilization Generation**: Visualize potential civilizations based on Drake equation results
- **Expansion Simulation**: Watch civilizations expand their spheres of influence over time
- **Collision Detection**: See what happens when expanding civilizations encounter each other

## How to Use

1. **Navigation**: Use mouse to rotate, scroll to zoom, and right-click drag to pan
2. **View Controls**: Focus on Earth or view the entire galaxy using the buttons
3. **Drake Equation**: Adjust sliders to modify equation parameters
4. **Generate Civilizations**: Click the button to create civilizations based on your parameters
5. **Time Simulation**: Use the slider to move forward/backward in time, or play/pause to animate
6. **Expansion Visualization**: Watch how different civilizations expand at varied rates

## Drake Equation Parameters

The Drake equation estimates the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy:

N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

Where:
- R* = Average rate of star formation (stars/year)
- fp = Fraction of stars with planets
- ne = Average habitable planets per star
- fl = Fraction of habitable planets with life
- fi = Fraction of life that develops intelligence
- fc = Fraction of intelligence that develops detectable technology
- L = Longevity of detectable civilizations (years)

## Simulation Details

- Each civilization is assigned a random expansion rate
- Spheres of influence grow at these different rates
- When two spheres intersect, both civilizations are marked in white
- Time slider allows exploration of various expansion scenarios
- Play/pause functionality for automatic simulation

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D visualization
- JavaScript for simulation logic
- HTML/CSS for UI and controls
